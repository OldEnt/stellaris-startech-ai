    #AI sometimes will get its wounded ships be near the starbase instead of being on a starbase
    #This causes them to "wait" for a repair that never comes and they get stuck forever
    #Since as far as I know there is no way to issue an orbit order via a script I can't fix this

    #The workaround I implemented is an event that will check if there any stuck ships and if they are it will heal them artificially using this modifier
    #These ships couldn't have been healed by a starbase if they were orbitting it, but since ships are just on a starbase without orbitting this workaround is needed.
