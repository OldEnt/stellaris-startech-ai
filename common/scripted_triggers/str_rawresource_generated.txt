#acceptable will mean that food+minerals+energy > 50
#fine will mean that food+minerals+energy > 150
#good will mean that food+minerals+energy > 300

#regarding needs_energy and really_needs_energy explanation will be slightly contrived

#incomes of
#(energy,minerals,food) = (0,50,0); (20, 80, 20), (40,110,40),(60,140,60),(80,170,80)
#are considered balanced

#needs_energy = yes you need energy to lag behind respective balanced point by 5 points
#assuming minerals and food can be turned into each other
#so if energy < 0 and minerals+food>50 then needs_energy=yes
#same holds if energy< 20 and minerals+food>50

#Note that if (and only if) incomes are around the balanced point then needs_X = yes for all X
#if incomes are far from balanced point at most two different resources trigger "needs"

#Trigger for "really_needs" is different, really_needs happens
#if a resource lags 20 units behind the balance point, so

#if energy<-20, minerals>50, food>0 ---> really_needs_energy = yes

#Note that "needs" assumes the other two resources can be freely converted and "really_needs"
#doesn't
